#P2_DataEngineering_Code_Challenge
This repository is in relation to a pre-Interview requirements
to solve the problem and showcase the basic skills from candidate.


## The Challenge:
The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate the candidate’s ability to interact with an API and perform analysis to deliver insight. Candidates will also be assessed on their overall proficiency at writing code. 
Instructions:
Write code to obtain the airlines dataset using the provided API:
https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/international-airlines-airline-by-country-of-port-data/resource/809c77d8-fd68-4a2c-806f-c63d64e69842


Manipulate the data to answer the following questions:
1.	How many passengers flew into and out of Australia for each airline in each month of 2019?
2.	In the last 6 months which port country was responsible for the most passengers coming into the country?
3.	What is the 3 month rolling average of freight arriving to Australia for each airline throughout 2018?
Constraints:
•	This challenge must be completed using either Python or Javascript. 
•	The use of any and all open-source packages or libraries is permitted.
Deliverables:
•	Executable script(s) or interactive notebook. All source code must be provided, including the code used to interact with the REST API.
•	Results and any explanations should be output to a separate CSV or TXT file. Alternatively, they can be displayed within the interactive notebook.
•	All results, code and documentation should be uploaded to a GitHub repository. Please make this repository publically accessible and provide a link with your submission.
Please send your submission to Alix Booth (alix.l.booth@boeing.com) by the agreed submission date.
